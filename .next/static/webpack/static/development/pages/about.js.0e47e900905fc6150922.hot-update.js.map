I started my journey as a developer in the fall of\n            2017. Ever since starting my development journey, I have fallen more\n            in love with the process. I started my way by learning symatic HTML\n            and CSS. I then began working my way through JavaScript. Since then,\n            I have build up my skillset by learning React, SASS, and Bootstrap.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Aside from coding, I also play music in a couple of musical\n            projects: The Lighthouse and the Whaler and Poro. This has really\n            inspired me to make sites for other musicians. Some of my other\n            passions include food, beer, magic, and comedy.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"right\" />\n      </StyledAbout>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAuBA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
